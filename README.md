To implement Full-Text Search (FTS) in PostgreSQL with Spring Boot, you'll need to utilize PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities along with Spring Data JPA. PostgreSQL provides powerful features for full-text search, including the ability to search for documents based on natural language processing techniques such as stemming, ranking, and more.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement Full-Text Search with PostgreSQL FTS in a Spring Boot application:

1. **Setup PostgreSQL FTS**: Ensure that your PostgreSQL database is configured to use Full-Text Search features. This typically involves creating a Full-Text Search index on the columns you want to search. For example, if you want to perform full-text search on the `name` and `description` columns of your `product` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX product_search_idx ON product USING gin(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description));
    ```

    This will create a Full-Text Search index that concatenates the `name` and `description` columns, tokenizes the text, and stores it in a GIN index.

2. **Entity Configuration**: Ensure that your `Product` entity class is mapped to the `product` table in your PostgreSQL database.

3. **Repository Configuration**: In your `ProductRepository` interface, you'll need to define a custom query method to perform the Full-Text Search. Spring Data JPA provides support for native queries, allowing you to execute custom SQL queries directly.

    ```java
    // ProductRepository.java
    public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {
        @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM product WHERE to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description) @@ to_tsquery('english', ?1)", nativeQuery = true)
        List<Product> searchByFullText(String query);
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `searchByFullText` method executes a native SQL query to perform Full-Text Search using the `@@` operator, which checks if the text search vector matches the query. We're using the `to_tsvector` and `to_tsquery` functions to convert the search query and the indexed text into tsvector and tsquery types, respectively.

4. **Service Layer**: Create a service class to encapsulate the business logic for searching products.

    ```java
    // ProductService.java
    @Service
    public class ProductService {
        @Autowired
        private ProductRepository productRepository;

        public List<Product> searchByFullText(String query) {
            return productRepository.searchByFullText(query);
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Controller Configuration**: Expose a REST endpoint in your controller to handle search requests.

    ```java
    // ProductController.java
    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/products")
    public class ProductController {
        @Autowired
        private ProductService productService;

        @GetMapping("/search")
        public ResponseEntity<List<Product>> searchByFullText(@RequestParam String query) {
            List<Product> products = productService.searchByFullText(query);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(products);
        }
    }
    ```

Now, you can send a GET request to `/products/search?query=search_query_here` to perform a Full-Text Search for products based on the provided query. The results will be returned as JSON objects containing the matching products.
